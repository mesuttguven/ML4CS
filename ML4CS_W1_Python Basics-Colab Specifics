#COLAB SPECIFICS: 

#Colab is a virtual machine you can access directly. To run commands at the VM's terminal, prefix the line with an exclamation point (!).

print("\nDoing $ls on filesystem")
!ls -l
!pwd

print("Install numpy")  # Just for test, numpy is actually preinstalled in all Colab instances
!pip install numpy

#List the path of the current directory (pwd)
#Go to / (cd) and list the content (ls -l)

!pwd
!cd /
!ls -l
print("Hello")

#SOME FINAL WORDS ON COLAB
#All usage of Colab in this course is completely free or charge. Even GPU usage is provided free of charge for some hours of usage every day.
#Many of the exercises in the course executes more quickly by using GPU runtime: Runtime | Change runtime type | Hardware accelerator |GPU
#You execute each cell in order, you can edit & re-execute cells if you want
#Sometimes, this could have unintended consequences. For example, if you add a dimension to an array and execute the cell multiple times, then the cells after may not work. If you encounter problem reset your environment:
#Runtime -> Restart runtime... Resets your Python shell
#Runtime -> Restart all runtimes... Will reset the Colab image, and get you back to a 100% clean environment
#You can also clear the output in the Colab by doing: Edit -> Clear all outputs
#Save to your Google Drive if you want a copy with your code/output: File -> Save a copy in Drive...
